# Tutorial: Your First PyTorch CNN for Fashion-MNIST Classification

This repository contains the code for a beginner-friendly tutorial on building, training, and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. The model is trained to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset into 10 different clothing categories.

This project covers the complete end-to-end workflow of a basic deep learning project, including data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, visualization, and saving/loading the trained model.

# Final Results

The trained CNN achieves an accuracy of approximately 88% on the 10,000-image Fashion-MNIST test set after 5 epochs of training.

my_first_cnn.ipynb - Achieved 88.57% in the provided notebook.

test.ipynb - Achieved 88.57% using the loaded model.

(Note: Your exact accuracy might vary slightly due to random initialization)

# Requirements

Python 3.9+

An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is highly recommended for reasonable training times. The code includes checks to fall back to CPU if CUDA is unavailable, but training will be significantly slower.

Required Python packages: torch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy, jupyterlab (or VS Code with Python/Jupyter extensions).

# Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/NemesisWaVe/pytorch-fashion-mnist-cnn.git]
cd pytorch-fashion-mnist-cnn


Create a Python Virtual Environment:
Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended to keep dependencies isolated.

# Create the environment (e.g., named 'venv')
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment:
# On Windows (cmd/powershell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate


You should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

Install Dependencies:
Install PyTorch, TorchVision, and Matplotlib using pip. Use the correct command for your system and CUDA version. The command below installs the version compatible with CUDA 12.1, which is common for modern NVIDIA drivers.

# Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support 
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121)

# Install other dependencies
pip install matplotlib jupyterlab numpy


If you don't have an NVIDIA GPU or don't want GPU support, use pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib jupyterlab numpy. Training will be very slow.

Check the official PyTorch website for the correct command matching your specific OS and CUDA version if needed.

# Running the Code

You can run the project using the provided Jupyter Notebooks:

Start Jupyter Lab (or use VS Code):
Make sure your virtual environment (venv) is activated in the terminal.

jupyter lab


Or, open the project folder in VS Code and ensure you select the Python interpreter from your venv (Ctrl+Shift+P -> Python: Select Interpreter).

Run the Training Notebook (my_first_cnn.ipynb):

Open my_first_cnn.ipynb.

Run the cells sequentially (using Shift+Enter or the Run button).

This notebook will:

Download the Fashion-MNIST dataset (first time only).

Define the CNN model architecture.

Train the model for 5 epochs using the GPU (if available).

Evaluate the trained model's accuracy on the test set.

Visualize some predictions using Matplotlib.

Save the trained model's weights to my_cnn_model.pth.

Run the Inference/Test Notebook (test.ipynb):

Open test.ipynb.

Run the cells sequentially.

This notebook demonstrates how to:

Define the same CNN architecture.

Load the pre-trained weights from my_cnn_model.pth.

Move the loaded model to the GPU.

Load the test dataset.

Evaluate the loaded model's accuracy on the test set (verifying it matches the training result).
